# Development Environment 

There are a few different ways to set up your environment:

1. Using Docker + VS Code + Remote Container extension
2. Using Docker Compose via command line
3. CreateReactApp directly via command line

Notes if using Docker (options 1 or 2): 

- You will need to have Docker already installed on your local machine. If you don't already have it installed, please use option 3 - it isn't necessary to learn a new tool (although it's very handy) for this exercise.

### Using Docker + VSCode + Remote Container extension

Open the root of this project in VS Code. If it is not already installed, you will be prompted to install the [Remote-Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension.

Once installed, VS Code will recognize a dev container configuration (in `./.devcontainer`) and ask to open the project in a container (which you should do!):

![VS Code reopen in container prompt](./README-assets/vs-code-open-in-container-prompt.png)

You can also open the command pallete (`CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + P`) and select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`

![VS Code reopen in container command](./README-assets/vs-code-reopen-incontainer.png)

After opening the project in a container you can access a shell inside the running Docker container (with `node` and `yarn` installed) using the built-in Terminal.

#### Starting the Express server

To run the Express server, use the `Run and Debug` panel on the left and click the green play button (or use `Run > Start Deugging` or `F5`) to start the Express app with the built-in debugger. You should now be able to set breakpoints and debug from inside of VS Code.

![VS Code start debugger](./README-assets/vs-code-start-debugger.png)

Any expected output from `server.js` will be in the `Debug Console` tab at the bottom, near `Terminal`

You should now be able to access the Express server at `http://localhost:3001`.

### Starting the Development Server

Open a new Terminal in VS Code and run

    yarn start

You should now be able to access the Express server at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Using Docker Compose via command line

To run the main Node application container (`app`) 

    docker-compose up

You can also run the container in the background using 

    docker-compose up -d 

And view logs for each container in a separate shell using `docker-compose logs`. For example:

    # Use the -f flag to tail the logs
    docker-compose logs -f app

To start a bash session inside the running Node app container run:

    docker-compose exec app /bin/bash

Here you should have access to `node` and `yarn`.


#### Starting the Express server

Within a session in the app container run

    yarn server
    # or
    npm run server 

You should now be able to access the Express server at `http://localhost:3001`.

### Starting the Development Server

Within another session in the app container run

    yarn start
    # or
    npm start

You should now be able to access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running everything directly via command line

Ensure you have Ruby 14.16.1 or higher installed. (Other versions may work, however this has only been tested on 14.16.1).

Next, install all npm modules:

    yarn install


#### Starting the Express server

    yarn server
    # or
    npm run server 

You should now be able to access the Express server at `http://localhost:3001`.

### Starting the Development Server

    yarn start
    # or
    npm start

You should now be able to access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Notes 

- This project was boostrapped using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). See [CREATE_REACT_APP_README.md](CREATE_REACT_APP_README.md) for more info on some of the scaffolding.
- This is meant to (hopefully) keep the amount of set up and configuration needed to start on the assignment to a minimum. Feel free to add any gems, npm packages or other tools that will be helpful!
- We are always improving our projects, so please share any feedback or suggestions on your experience.
